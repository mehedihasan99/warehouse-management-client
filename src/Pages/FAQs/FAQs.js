            <h5 className='fw-bold'>RETURNS & EXCHANGES</h5>
            <p>All items sold are final sale and are ineligible for return or exchange. </p>
            <h5 className='fw-bold'>SHIPPING</h5>
            <p>All orders are shipped via USPS and have a tracking number. Orders are shipped out within 1-5 business days of when the order was placed. Orders are shipping Monday-Friday. Shipping prices are calculated during the check-out process and are based on weight and your location within the United States. Please double check your shipping address when you receive your order confirmation as we are NOT responsible for packages that are lost, missing, or delivered to incorrect addresses.</p>
            <h5 className='fw-bold'>TRACKED SHIPPING </h5>
            <p>Once your order has been shipped, you will receive an email with a tracking number so that you can track your order.</p>
            <h5 className='fw-bold'>SIZING AND FIT MEASUREMENTS</h5>
            <p>All our vintage garments are measured from seam to seam whilst lying on a flat surface and doubled where necessary. Measurements are taken for shoulders, bust, waist, hips, sleeves and length and noted in each listing.</p>
            <p>If you require any further measurements before placing an order please contact us.</p>
            <p>To ensure a good fit, it is recommended that you compare the measurements of a garment from your existing wardrobe which fits well, to those of the listed items.
            </p>
            <p>*Please understand the measurements given are of the clothing and not your personal measurements. Ideally you should be smaller than the specified sizes to allow for freedom of movement and a good fit.</p>
            <h5 className='fw-bold'>BE CAREFUL</h5>
            <p>All items are therefore sold as seen, with any minor wear and tear generally being seen as acceptable. It is never our intention to withhold details such as these, rather sometimes these things are difficult to spot no matter how careful one is.</p>
